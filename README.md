# DiceGame
As part of Angela Yu's web development course, I created a Dice Roll Game. This web-based game replicates the thrill of rolling physical dice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a user-friendly interface, players can click a button to roll the dice, making it a fun and interactive project that showcases my web development skills.
